# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the current game-specific instant search database into a generic, reusable database system that can be easily adapted for various use cases. The enhancement includes comprehensive documentation, configuration options, and guidelines for administrators to customize the system for different domains while maintaining the existing high-performance search capabilities and intuitive UI.

## Requirements

2. WHEN an administrator reviews the documentation THEN the system SHALL include step-by-step customization guidelines
3. WHEN an administrator wants to modify the system THEN the system SHALL provide clear instructions for data structure changes
4. WHEN an administrator needs to understand the system architecture THEN the system SHALL include technical documentation explaining all components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want flexible configuration options, so that I can customize categories, icons, and data fields without modifying core code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator wants to change categories THEN the system SHALL support configuration-based category management
2. WHEN an administrator needs different icons THEN the system SHALL provide a configurable icon mapping system
3. WHEN an administrator requires different data fields THEN the system SHALL support flexible CSV column mapping
4. WHEN an administrator updates configuration THEN the system SHALL automatically reflect changes without code modification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want data management guidelines, so that I can efficiently maintain and update the database content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator needs to add new items THEN the system SHALL provide clear CSV formatting guidelines
2. WHEN an administrator wants to bulk update data THEN the system SHALL support CSV import/export workflows
3. WHEN an administrator encounters data issues THEN the system SHALL provide troubleshooting guidelines
4. WHEN an administrator needs to backup data THEN the system SHALL include data backup and restore procedures

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want deployment and scaling guidelines, so that I can deploy this system in different environments and scale it appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs to deploy the system THEN the system SHALL provide environment-specific deployment guides
2. WHEN a developer wants to scale the system THEN the system SHALL include performance optimization guidelines
3. WHEN a developer needs to integrate with other systems THEN the system SHALL provide API documentation and integration examples
4. WHEN a developer encounters issues THEN the system SHALL include comprehensive troubleshooting documentation

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the system to work consistently across different domains, so that I can use the same interface regardless of the data type being searched.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses any instance of the system THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent UI/UX patterns
2. WHEN a user performs searches THEN the system SHALL provide the same high-performance search experience
3. WHEN a user navigates categories THEN the system SHALL maintain the same interaction patterns
4. WHEN a user accesses the system on different devices THEN the system SHALL provide consistent responsive behavior

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want example configurations for common use cases, so that I can quickly set up the system for typical scenarios.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator wants to create a product catalog THEN the system SHALL provide a pre-configured example
2. WHEN an administrator wants to create a document library THEN the system SHALL provide a pre-configured example
3. WHEN an administrator wants to create an inventory system THEN the system SHALL provide a pre-configured example
4. WHEN an administrator reviews examples THEN the system SHALL include detailed explanations of each configuration choice
